Cross-session memory for [DeepSeek Harness](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness) (DSH).

**The idea**: every workspace keeps a structured memory database (`.dsh-meow/memory.db`,
SQLite via `node:sqlite`). The static tool manual (seven layers + every `memory_*` tool's
usage) lives in the **system prompt** as a fixed section — constant text, so your LLM
provider's KV/context cache stays untouched. Dynamic content (soul/user in full, design
principles, memory guide) is injected as a **prefix of the first user message**, and the
first turn injects long-term memory only — no keyword hits. From the second user message
on, every message gets a keyword hit (top-2). The model deep-dives into the rest on demand
with `memory_search` / `memory_project`. Each window's own agent consolidates its memories
when idle ("dream") — memories it created plus ones it was shown — with the window's knowledge
frozen at the last conversation timestamp.

## ✨ Features

- **Seven memory layers** (`soul` = the AI itself / `user` = user basics & preferences /
  `project` = per-project info with `subcategory` (overview/structure/decisions/quotes/ops/todo) /
  `fact` = atomic facts / `lesson` = mistakes & corrections / `topic` = ongoing discussion arcs
  with a goal sentence / `rules` = design principles & behavioral rules). One SQLite table
  per layer, UUIDs are time-prefixed so id order == creation order.
- **First-turn injection (long-term memory block)**: before the first user message, a fixed
  format is injected: `===== 长期记忆 =====` → `【关于你】` (all soul entries) →
  `【关于user】` (all user entries) → `【设计原则】` (global rules with importance ≥ 2 —
  few, imperative guidelines) → `【记忆导引】` (usage note + the dynamic "all your projects"
  list for `memory_project`). The memory is inserted as an independent plugin snapshot directly
  before the real user message; the user's prompt is never rewritten. **No keyword hits on the
  first turn** (hits start from the second message). Even when the first user message arrives
  batched with a plugin notice (e.g. an approval-policy change notification), the snapshot still
  lands directly before the real user message and hits never fire early.
- **Per-message keyword hits**: from the second user message on, every real user message is
  matched against fact/lesson/rules/topic (scope = global + current-project anchor),
  top-2 hits are injected under a "可能相关的记忆，仅供参考：" prefix. Matching is based on
  **entry keywords** (LLM-extracted or auto bigram) — not full text, which is noisy.
  Scoring = intersection × idf × coverage × Ebbinghaus decay (by memory timestamp) ×
  importance weight × title bonus.
- **Current-project anchor**: any `memory_remember/search/update/project` call with a
  `project` parameter anchors the session's current project; unanchored sessions only hit
  global entries (casual chat stays unaffected).
- **Cache-friendly by design**: the static `meow-memory:guide` section (order 130, right
  after the `tool:*` guidance sections) is registered in the system prompt once — constant
  text, KV-cache friendly. Already-seen memories (`injected` + `searched`) are recorded per
  session (`.dsh-meow/sessions/<id>.json`): injection never repeats, and `memory_search`
  takes the top 5 by relevance unconditionally (seen / this-session memories included), then
  fills the rest from the ranking while skipping already-seen entries; a session-compaction
  signal (`compaction/*`) releases the seen records so compressed-away
  memories can be hit again.
- **Post-compaction re-injection**: after a session is compacted (manual `/compact` or
  automatic token-pressure compaction), the next user-message turn automatically re-injects
  the long-term memory snapshot plus the project overviews this session previously fetched
  via `memory_project`, plus the entries this session itself wrote or updated through
  `memory_remember`/`memory_update` (all rebuilt from the latest data) — the memory
  compacted away comes back within one turn, so the AI never suddenly goes amnesiac
  after compaction.
- **Toolset**: `memory_remember` (write, dedup merge, returns read-back confirmation:
  keywords/project; accepts a `keywords` parameter — reflection/dream turns have the LLM
  summarize 5–10 content words, auto bigram extraction as fallback) / `memory_search`
  (BM25 × recency, filters: level/project/status/days, default top10 = top 5 by relevance
  without excluding seen + 5 more skipping already-seen entries, sorted by memory timestamp) /
  `memory_project` (whole-project injection paragraph: **`project` parameter is required** — which project do you want? grouped by subcategory, all
  non-stale entries, todo section with latest 5 done + to-do list, plus memory-db &
  session-history pointers) / `memory_find_similar` (duplicate & conflict detection) /
  `memory_read` / `memory_update` (incl. status active/archived/stale, importance, goal,
  manual keyword fixes) / `memory_dream` (manual trigger; you can also just type the
  `/dream` command in the composer).
- **Memory timestamp** (`updated_at` = last update time): refreshed by dream stamping or
  any `memory_update`. Displayed timestamps are always `updated_at`; search (work view) shows
  relative time, hit-injection / memory_project (full-text view) show relative + absolute
  (e.g. "2026-08-15 10:58 [2 days ago]").
- **Project attribution**: global info gets `project: "全局"` (distinct from blank = unmarked);
  multi-project info uses comma-separated names (e.g. `"dsh, femwa"`) — search/hits match
  "contains current project name OR global".
- **Per-window dream**: a window becomes dream-eligible once idle ≥ `idleMinutes` (default
  **180 min = 3 hours**, replacing the old night window); every window whose last chat is
  newer than its last dream gets consolidated by its own main agent — round-based (atomic:
  project/fact/lesson/rules/soul/user, then topic, then a project-summary round whenever the
  window touched concrete projects — it re-checks each project via memory_project, distills
  concise long-term entries and archives the superseded ones), project sub-headings, memories
  it created plus ones it was shown (injected / searched / read via memory_read) — using its
  full conversation context; long-stable rules aren't re-reviewed every dream
  (`dream.rulesReviewDays`, default 2 days, keeps churn-y no-op updates away).
  **Peak-hour suppression**
  (in the configured `timeZone`, default Asia/Shanghai): no dream starts inside
  `suppressWindows` (default 09:00–12:00 & 14:00–18:00, API peak-tariff hours) nor within
  `suppressLeadMinutes` (default 15) before each window — it fires on the next check cycle
  after the peak ends; a dream already in progress is never interrupted. Old windows (no live
  agent, >24h) and archived sessions are left alone.
- **`/dream` command**: no need to wait for the idle trigger — type `/dream` in the composer
  to start consolidating this window's memories right away (same semantics as the
  `memory_dream` tool, immune to peak-hour suppression). Executed by the dsh command plane,
  never sent to the model; shows up in the `/` autocomplete menu. A consolidation already in
  progress is reported clearly instead of being started twice.
- **Skip dream consolidation (client)**: don't want a window's memories auto-consolidated?
  Open the "…" menu on its sidebar row and click **"跳过梦境整理记忆" (skip dream
  consolidation)**; click **"取消跳过梦境整理记忆" (un-skip)** to restore. Skipped windows are
  never picked up by the idle timer again, while `/dream` and `memory_dream` keep working,
  and their session row shows a **muted-gray "moon with slash" icon** at a glance. The skip
  flag persists across restarts and stays consistent across both instances (shared
  memory database).
- **Reflection**: after ≥7 consecutive tool steps within one task the plugin asks the
  model whether anything since the last consolidation is worth remembering. A turn whose
  last tool is a `memory_*` tool counts as already having consolidated (no re-reflection);
  cancelled turns never trigger it.
- **Per-session memory toggle (client, v0.28.0; model-side zero footprint v0.32.0)**: a
  **「记忆」** switch next to the composer's send button (green dot = enabled / grey dot =
  disabled), independent per session and persisted. Enabled: normal inject/search/generate.
  **Disabled: no injection, no keyword hits, no reflection, no auto dream, `memory_*` tools
  return a "memory disabled" error**, and since v0.32.0 the **model context carries zero
  memory footprint** — the memory manual section and all `memory_*` tool definitions are
  stripped per-session at the `system-prompt/assemble` waterfall, and previously injected
  long-term memory / hit blocks are removed from the model context when a session is toggled
  off mid-conversation (the session record itself is untouched). A notice bar reads
  "本会话记忆已禁用：不注入 · 不检索 · 不生成（点「记忆」可恢复）"; subagents inherit
  the parent session's state. The viewer panel and settings page stay available (explicit
  user actions).
- **Injection-fold UI (client)**: first-turn long-term memory / per-message keyword hits
  collapse into a slim "injected memory" bar (same width as the user bubble) — click to see
  the full injected text; the user prompt shows as a bubble, keeping the flow clean.
  Only plain-text messages are folded (attachment-bearing ones stay untouched).
- **Reflection-fold UI (client)**: reflection/dream turns (prompt, think, tool calls and
  the report) collapse into a slim bar (collapsed by default, showing "N memories added" /
  "dream task"); clicking expands it into a card — Think / tool calls / context injections
  inside the card are expandable for details.
- **Memory viewer (client, v0.27.0)**: a memory icon in the sidebar's global-panel area opens
  a full-size browser — **Global** (cross-workspace KPIs, workspace cards, cross-DB recent
  updates, each workspace's `project="全局"` entries, health checks, dream log, cross-workspace
  search) / **Workspace** (project tree, layer filters, BM25 search, detail drawer with
  `findSimilar` neighbours, timeline / dream log / session footprints) / **Star map** (Canvas:
  constellation layout by default, force-directed as an option; structural / similarity /
  session / supersede edges toggle independently; layer toggles only change opacity, so node
  positions stay stable). **Strictly read-only**: cross-workspace reads use a `node:sqlite`
  read-only connection (never creates or writes another workspace's DB) and the `workspace`
  parameter is allow-listed.
- **Session-list dream icon (client)**: sessions that have been dream-consolidated with no
  new conversation activity since show a **pale-yellow crescent-moon icon 🌙**; while a dream
  turn is running the moon **breathes white→gold** (sitting to the left of dsh's status dots,
  so it can't be mistaken for normal work); **skip-dreamed** sessions show a **muted-gray
  "moon with slash"** instead (un-skipping falls back to the crescent; priority: breathing >
  skipped > crescent); new activity removes the icon. The icon is prepended into the dsh
  session row's status slot, left of its status dots — only self-created nodes are added or
  removed, never rewriting React-owned children (replacing the slot's content desyncs React's
  virtual DOM: the next commit throws removeChild NotFoundError and unmounts the whole
  sidebar tree). Data flows through a page-wide shared 60s polling diff (v0.23.0
  connection-pool fix, replacing the former SSE stream): one GET each against
  `/meow-memory/dreamed-sessions` and `/meow-memory/skip-dreams` — `state:'dreaming'` when a
  dream starts, `state:'dreamed'` when it finishes, `state:'active'` when a session gets new
  activity, and `state:'skip'/'unskip'` when the skip flag flips; the client reconciles once
  on mount. Row targeting needs zero dsh changes: it reads the React 18 fiber
  (`__reactFiber$` internal property) to get the row's render key = session id — no title
  matching.
- **Dream anti-repeat**: DB-atomic 60s check gate + atomic start claim (`dream_pending`) +
  interrupted-dream auto-recovery + orphan finalization (a finished dream turn always lands
  `last_dream_time`, even across hot-reload instances); plugin-turn events don't refresh
  window activity — an already-dreamed window is never re-dreamed.
- **Zero runtime dependencies**: `node:sqlite` (default-enabled on Node ≥22.13; 22.5–22.12 needs
  `--experimental-sqlite`) + self-contained esbuild bundle (`lib/index.js`). No native modules.

## 📦 Install

### Via npm (published package)

```sh
# 1. Install into the profile's node_modules (the loader resolves plugins there)
cd $DSH_HOME/profiles/web          # default home: ~/.dsh/profiles/web
npm install meow-memory

# 2. Add the package to the profile's assembly bundles in package.json (recommended since v0.9.0):
#    "dsh": { "profile": { "bundles": ["@deepseek-ai/dsh-base", "@deepseek-ai/dsh-web-app", "meow-memory"] } }
#    (the package ships a dsh.bundle.patch; bundle assembly inserts it. Profile-patch
#     `insert` entries address existing ids — a new plugin not in the tree reports
#     "entry not found", so new plugins go through the bundles array.)

# 3. Restart dsh web. New sessions pick up the plugin automatically.
```

### By hand (any DSH install, no npm needed)

1. Copy (or symlink) this package into the profile's `node_modules`:
   ```sh
   mkdir -p ~/.dsh/profiles/web/node_modules
   ln -s /path/to/meow-memory ~/.dsh/profiles/web/node_modules/meow-memory
   ```
   (On Windows: `New-Item -ItemType Junction ...` — NTFS junction, no admin needed.)
2. Add `meow-memory` to the profile `package.json`'s `dsh.profile.bundles` (same as above).
3. Restart `dsh web`. New sessions pick up the plugin automatically.

## 🔌 Compatibility

Supports **dsh 0.1.5** (including the latest `0.1.5-rc.1`) and stays backward compatible with older releases — upgrading dsh needs no change to this plugin or its configuration.

The plugin never hardcodes a version: it probes host capabilities at runtime, so new and old releases each take their correct branch. Both generations are verified — on `0.1.5-rc.1` first-turn injection, memory tool calls, and client rendering all work; on `0.1.1-rc.2` behavior is unchanged from previous releases.

## ⚙️ Configuration

All fields are optional (profile patch or `cordis.patch.yml`). **You don't have to hand-edit files**: the DSH settings page has a dedicated "喵记忆" tab for this plugin (peer of General/Models/Plugins) where every option below is editable in place, saved per-field with one-click restore-to-default (restoring means the plugin's built-in factory default, not the patch baseline); reload/restart the meow-memory plugin after saving for changes to take effect.

```yaml
- id: meow-memory
  name: 'meow-memory'
  config:
    enabled: true          # master switch
    projectDir: '.dsh-meow' # memory directory, relative to the workspace

          end: '18:00'

      rulesReviewDays: 2    # stable rules whose updated_at is older than this many
                            # days are skipped in dream round 1 (anti-churn); 0 = off
    delegate:
      model: ''            # model override for memory work (optional): when set,
                           # reflection turns and dream rounds automatically run on
                           # this model and switch back to the main model afterwards;
                           # 'provider/model' sets both, 'model' swaps the model only
                           # (provider inherited); empty = always the main model
```

### Model override for memory work (optional)

The reflection turn and each dream group always run in the main window (steer) — prompts, replies, and tool calls land in the main session log (the fold UI keeps them tidy). The standalone fork-subagent execution mode was removed in v0.24; there is no longer an "independent execution" switch.

To run memory work on a different (cheaper) model: with `delegate.model` set, every LLM request issued during reflection/dream turns gets its provider/model overridden via dsh's `agent/request` waterfall, and the main model takes over again once the turn ends — normal conversation and tool rounds are untouched. The implementation is stateless: each request is judged by whether the current turn carries a reflection/dream directive marker, so user aborts, crashes, and hot reloads can never leave a stuck "overridden" state.

### promptLang: prompt & retrieval language (important)

`promptLang` decides two things: ① the language of injected/reflection/dream prompts; ② the language of tool descriptions. It also shapes the language the model writes memory entries in — keywords are extracted in the entry's language, so **go with your chat language**.

**Set it explicitly on first use**: `'zh'` (default) or `'en'` (built-in English language pack). If your chat language differs from your UI language, **go with your chat language**.

On the retrieval side: the BM25 tokenizer is language-independent since v0.20.0 (category routing) — a language mismatch between queries and stored entries no longer degrades recall; `en` additionally enables English normalization (stopword filter + Porter stemmer), so inflected queries still hit stored entries (`tokenizers` matches `tokenizer`).

Language packs are data files (one directory per language under `src/prompts/`, hot-read at runtime — no code changes needed). See [`src/prompts/README.md`](src/prompts/README.md) for the contributor guide and `npm run check-lang`. Instance-level overrides: drop same-named slot files into `<home>/.dsh-meow/prompts/<lang>/` (partial overrides welcome).

## 🔭 Memory viewer (v0.27.0)

**Where**: the sidebar's global-panel area gains a memory icon (`sidebar.panellist`); clicking it swaps the centre panel to the viewer (`main` slot, key = `meow-memory`). Both are official dsh extension points — the id/key match is what pairs them — so no dsh changes are needed.

**Three views**: Global (cross-workspace KPIs, workspace cards, cross-DB recent updates, per-workspace `project="全局"` entries, health checks, dream log, cross-workspace search) · Workspace (project tree, layer/status/day filters, server-side BM25 search, detail drawer with full metadata and `findSimilar` neighbours, plus timeline / dream log / session-footprint tabs) · Star map (Canvas; constellation layout by default, force-directed optional; structural / similarity / session-read-write / supersede edges toggle independently).

**Read-only data face** — one `prefix` route `/meow-memory/api`: `context`, `workspaces`, `overview`, `memories`, `memory`, `similar`, `projects`, `timeline`, `dreams`, `sessions`, `search`, `graph`. Responses are `{ ok, data, meta: { generatedAt, etag, partial } }`; `If-None-Match` yields 304, and `partial` lists workspaces that failed to read (one broken DB never breaks the global view).

**Read-only is a hard constraint**: cross-workspace reads open `new DatabaseSync(path, { readOnly: true })` — it refuses writes *and* refuses to open a missing file, so another workspace's DB can never be created or mutated. The plugin deliberately does **not** reuse `getDb()` (that one `mkdirSync`s, creates tables and runs migrations). The `workspace` parameter is always checked against the allow-list (`workspaceRegistry.list().path` ∪ session window index); anything else is 403.

**Where star-map edges come from**: structural edges (`project`, `source_session` — straight from fields), similarity edges (keyword inverted index + bigram cosine, thresholded and top-K pruned, drawn dashed), session edges (`sessions/<id>.json` injection/search/access/write traces) and supersede edges (same layer + high similarity + one superseded). There is **no declarative `links` column**, so inter-memory relations are inferred; a true knowledge graph would need a new field in v2. Node/edge caps trigger downsampling, reported via `stats.truncated`.

> ⚠️ **Upgrading**: profile plugins are loaded from the profile's `node_modules`, so **a changed `lib/` only takes effect after restarting `dsh web`** (profile plugins do not hot-reload). After the restart, refresh the page. If you see "viewer data face unavailable", the host is still running the old code (`GET /meow-memory/api/workspaces` returns 404).

## 🛠 Development

```sh
npm install
npm run build          # esbuild bundle → lib/index.js (self-contained)
npm run test           # 228 logic tests: db / bm25 / migrate / inject / reflect / dream / tools / apply
```

The `@deepseek-ai/*` packages live in the dsh-meow pnpm workspace, not in this package's
`node_modules`. On Windows, `npm run link-workspace` (or `scripts/link-workspace.ps1`)
creates junction mirrors of the workspace packages so esbuild can resolve them;
`build.mjs` uses `nodePaths` to pick them up. The links are build-time only.
